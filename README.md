If you dont have the data files, go to line 3 and change the working directory where you want to download data. Then go to line 17 and change the working directory where "UCI HAR Dataset" was unziped.

If you already have the data, you can change line 17 and put the working directory where "UCI HAR Dataset" was unziped. You can begin from there.

Saludos, Carlos.
